        '''One day, a fox became very hungry as he went to search for some food. He searched high and low, but couldn’t find something that he could eat.

Finally, as his stomach rumbled, he stumbled upon a farmer’s wall. At the top of the wall, he saw the biggest, juiciest grapes he’d ever seen. They had a rich, purple color, telling the fox they were ready to be eaten.

To reach the grapes, the fox had to jump high in the air. As he jumped, he opened his mouth to catch the grapes, but he missed. The fox tried again but missed yet again.

He tried a few more times but kept failing.

Finally, the fox decided it was time to give up and go home. While he walked away, he muttered, “I’m sure the grapes were sour anyway.'''

        '''A lion was asleep in the sun one day. A little mouse came out to play. The little mouse ran up the lion’s neck and slid down his back. The lion caught him with a great big smack!

‘I’m going to eat you!’ the lion roared, his mouth open wide.

‘No, no, please don’t!’ the little mouse cried. ‘Be kind to me and one day I’ll help you.’

‘I’m a lion! You’re a mouse! What can you do?’ The lion laughed, very hard, and the mouse ran away.

But the mouse was out walking the very next day. He heard a big roar, and squeaked when he saw the king of the jungle tied to a tree. But the mouse had a plan to set him free. The mouse worked quickly and chewed through the rope.

The lion said, ‘Oh little mouse, I had no hope. You were right, little mouse – thank you, I’m free. You’re the best friend there ever could be!’'''

        '''One afternoon, I went to a shop to buy some ink. There was only one young shop assistant in it. He was reading a book.

“I want to buy a bottle of ink”, I said. There was no answer. He was still going on reading his book. Then I asked again.

He stood up and gave me a bottle of ink. When I was out of the shop, I found that the change he gave me was too much. So I went back to the shop. The man pulled a long face when he saw me again.

“Now, what do you want to buy?”, he said angrily.

Nothing”, I said: “You gave me too much change just now. I want to give you back the money”.

“Ah, ah, thank you”, the man said with a red face.'''

You can wait a while to make my meat taste much better. The grass in my stomach will be digested quickly if you let me dance.” The wolf agreed.

While the lamb was dancing,she had a new idea. She said, “I can dance faster if you take my bell and ring it so hard.” The wolf took the bell and started to ring so hard. The shepherd heard the sound and ran quickly to save the lamb’s life.'''

But the pitcher was high and had a narrow neck, and no matter how he tried, the crow could not reach the water. The poor thing felt as if he would die of thirst.

Then an idea came to him. Picking up some small pebbles, he dropped them into the pitcher one by one. With each pebble the water rose a little higher until at last it was high enough so he could drink.'''

One day, while going to the city through a forest, he got surrounded by some robbers. One of them asked: “What do you have?”. The boy answered, “I have fifty rupees”. They searched for him but couldn’t find anything.

When they were about to go, the boy called out: “I am not telling a lie. See this fifty rupee note which I had hidden in my shirt”. The leader of the robbers felt pleased at the truthfulness of the boy, and gave him hundred rupees as reward and went away.'''

“Yes, Mummy,” the two boys answered and they went out. They played for half an hour, and then Billy ran into the kitchen. “Mummy,” he said, “Bobby’s broken a window in Mrs Allen’s house.” Mrs Allen was one of their neighbors.

“He’s a bad boy,” his mother said, “How did he break it?”

“I threw a stone at him,” Billy answered, “and he quickly moved down.!'''

The two frogs ignored the comments and tried to jump up out of the pit with all of their might. The other frogs kept telling them to stop, that they were as good as dead. Finally, one of the frogs took heed to what the other frogs were saying and gave up. He fell down and died.

The other frog continued to jump as hard as he could. Once again, the crowd of frogs yelled at him to stop the pain and just die. He jumped even harder and finally made it out. When he got out, the other frogs said, “Did you not hear us?”. The frog explained to them that he was deaf. He thought they were encouraging him the entire time. '''

        '''A long time ago, a farmer took a big bag of seeds to sell at the market.

Suddenly, his cart’s wheel hit a big stone. Bump! One of the seeds fell out of the bag and onto the hot, dry ground.

‘I’m scared!’ said the seed. ‘I need to be safe under the soil.’ Just then, a buffalo walked on the seed and pushed it into the ground.

‘I’m thirsty!’ said the seed. ‘I need some water to help me grow.’ Just then, it started to rain.

The next morning the seed had a little green shoot. All day it sat in the sun and grew

taller and taller.

The next day it had its first leaf. This helped it to catch sunlight and grow.

That evening a hungry bird tried to eat it, but the seed had roots to help it stay in the

ground.

Many years of sunshine and rain passed. The seed became a plant and then the plant became a tree.

Today if you visit the countryside you can see the tree. It is big and strong and now makes seeds of its own.”'''

    'content': '''"The wind and the sun are having a disagreement.

“I am the most powerful!” says the wind.

“No, I am the most powerful!” says the sun.

“I can blow trees to the ground!” brags the wind. “I can push ships across the ocean. I can make hurricanes and tornadoes!”

“Is that right?” replies the sun. “Well, I can melt all the snow on the mountains. I can dry up an entire lake. I can make a sidewalk so hot that it cooks an egg!”

Just then, they see a man walking along the road in his winter jacket.

“Let’s have a contest to see who is more powerful,” says the wind. “Whoever can remove the man’s jacket first wins.”

The sun agrees. The wind goes first. He blows a gust of cold wind at the man.

The man shivers and zips up his jacket. “Brrr! What a cold and windy day!”

It starts to rain. The wind blows even harder and turns the rain into snow.

“Well look at that! It’s snowing!” says the man. “Snow wasn’t in the weather forecast today...”

He pulls his hood over his head.

The wind blows his strongest gust towards the man, but the man’s jacket stays on.

"Hmm. It’s a bit fresh today…” he says. “A winter storm must be coming..." He zips the jacket higher to cover his nose.

“Gah! This is impossible,” says the wind. He stops blowing. “My turn!” says the sun.

First the sun shines enough to stop the snow. The man unzips his hood.

Then the sun pulls the clouds apart and gently shines down on the man. Suddenly, it is a beautiful spring day.

“Wow. The weather sure is strange around here!” says the man. He unzips his jacket.

The sun gently wiggles her fingers and increases the temperature.

“What strange weather. Now it feels like summer!” the man says as he begins to sweat. "Goodness me, it's so hot!"

He removes his winter jacket. He lies down on the grass for a nap in the warm sun.

"I win!" says the sun, beaming."'''
